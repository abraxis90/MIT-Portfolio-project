            <br> <strong>Teaching Background</strong>
            During her geek younger years, Erica has always been fond of sharing her knowledge to others. She was a type A+ of student and former government scholar who excels both in academics and non-academics curricular activities.  
            <br> She was a private tutor for children, her classmates and other individuals who asked for her support. In times of needs (when professor is sick, etc.), she used to substitute some of her professors to handle specific topics for class discussions.    
            <br> <strong>Basic Instructional Designs</strong>
            <br> Her younger years as temporary substitute for her former professors/teachers had exposed her to lesson plans and exam material preparations. Her former teachers had taught her how to draft lesson plans, craft exam materials and how to handle some specific behavioural learning patterns of their students.
            <br> <strong>As a Coding student now</strong>
            <br>Her current status of being a programming student and a passionate former teacher in the past is quite an inspiration for her to come up with her cute cheatsheet ideas. Originally, she wanted to make the reviewers for her own fast phasing learning ,
             then she decided to share it with others as contribution to the tech community.
