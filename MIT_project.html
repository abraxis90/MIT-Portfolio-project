            <br> <strong>Teaching Background</strong>
            During her geek younger years, Erica has always been fond of sharing her knowledge to others. She was a type A+ of student and former government scholar who did excel both in academics and non-academics curricular activities.  
            <br> She was a private tutor for children, her classmates and other individuals who asked for her support. In times of needs (when professor was sick, etc.), she used to substitute some of her professors to handle specific topics for class discussions.    
            <br> <strong>Basic Instructional Designs</strong>
            <br> Her younger years as temporary substitute for her former professors/teachers had exposed her to lesson plans and exam material preparations. Her former teachers had taught her how to draft lesson plans, craft exam materials and how to handle some specific behavioural learning patterns of their students.
            <br> <strong>Founding online tutorial schools</strong>
            <br>This teaching background and her passion in sharing high quality education have helped her understand the fundamentals
            of instructional designs, which later on became one of her building blocks on successfully establishing her own German school that had a total of 50-100 employees&contractors within 4 yrs of its operation.
